"Life on Land", a collaborative website dedicated to promoting Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) - Life on Land, was created by a team of dedicated students at IIT. Our website aims to raise awareness about preserving terrestrial ecosystems, protecting biodiversity, and combating desertification and land degradation. We invite you to explore our website, learn about the vital role of terrestrial ecosystems, and join us in taking action to preserve and protect our planet's biodiversity for generations to come.
